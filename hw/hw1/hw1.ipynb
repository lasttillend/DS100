The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health and we have made these data available to you via the DS 100 repository. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored. We will walk through the various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this.

    "What we see when we opened the file above is good news! It looks like this file is indeed a csv file. Let's check the other three files. This time, rather than opening up the files manually, let's use Python to print out the first 5 lines of each. The `ds100_utils` library has a method called `head` that will allow you to retrieve the first N lines of a file as a list. For example `ds100_utils.head('data/legend.csv', 5)` will return the first 5 lines of \"data/legend.csv\". Try using this function to print out the first 5 lines of all four files that we just extracted from the zipfile."

How many occurrences of each value is in the DataFrame? What are the implications for further analysis? For this problem, you need only fill in the string with a description; there's no specific dataframe or series that you need to create."

The discreteness of this variable means that we can use a barplot to visualize the distribution of the inspection score. Find the counts of the number of inspections for each score. Specifically, create a series in `scoreCts` where the index is the score and the value is the number of times that score was given.\n",
